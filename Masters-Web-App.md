# Masters-Web-App

This simple web application is intended to faciliate a masters pick-em pool.  It takes a *CSV* with the names of the competitors in the pool and their top 6 golfer picks.  The program then pulls golfer scores from ESPN and displays the standings of the pool, via the templated *masters.html*.  The program is intended to be run through an Apache HTTPD.
